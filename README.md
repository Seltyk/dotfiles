# wundrweapon's dotfiles
This repo effectively covers most (if not all?) of the configuration files on my Void system
In this document you will find a rundown of these files and the tools that I use (some of which needn't have any dotfiles)

But first, before anyone asks, this is Public Domain for the sole and explicit reason that it's just some configuration; do with my style as you please - I don't *own* a preference of style/function â€” that's ridiculous

It should be noted that my .bashrc is a ***mess*** and I highly advise nobody look at it yet...
